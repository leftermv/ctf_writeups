# CTF Writeups

Hi there. This is a write-up that I will (hopefully) update with new writeups as I learn new stuff. 

I do this as a way to make sure I'll do my best to learn in order to be able to provide a complete and correct write up for the CTFs I'm making and to serve me as reference later in time.

In other words, this repository is more for myself than for public viewers, but I'll leave it public in case someone is looking for writeups for the same CTFs and stumbles upon this repo.
