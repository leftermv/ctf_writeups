- We're getting a image with a tank with the text `STEG in HIDDEn place`.

- I tried using `steghide --extract -sf` on the image but it ask for a passphase.

- So I've used `stegcracker` with `rockyou.txt`. However, I left it run for ~30 minutes and no result, so I assumed I must've taken the wrong approach.

- The image is with a tank... so I've googled `stug tank`. I found [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz_III)

- I tried `tank`, `Sturmgeschütz`, `Sturmgeschütz_III` and `stug` as password. 

- The latter worked and we got our flag.
