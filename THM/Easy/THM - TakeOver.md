- I have added `futurevera.thm` in `/etc/hosts`.
- After that, I've started fuzzing for subdomains

```
ffuf -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -u https://IP:443 -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 100 -fl 92
```

```
blog                    [Status: 200, Size: 3838, Words: 1326, Lines: 81]
support                 [Status: 200, Size: 1522, Words: 367, Lines: 34]
```

- I have chosen to use `-fl 92` to filter false positives that had a content length of 92 lines.

- I have added `blog.futurevera.thm` and `support.futurevera.thm` to `/etc/hosts`.

- I took a look around the pages, tried directory and subdomain enumeration, but I couldn't find any info.

- I have decided to fuzz for potential subdomains using another wordlist

```
ffuf -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -u https://IP -w subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -t 100 -fl 92
```

- Nothing new popped up, so I assumed I missed something.

- I really couldn't find anything on `blog.futurevera.thm`, but `support` had a message saying they're rebuilding the support website, so I had a feeling it must be around here.

- I spent two eternities, but I finally ran out of ideas and checked the little paddle lock in the URL bar and clicked on `Connection not secure -> More Information -> View Certificate`.

- The certificate had the a value assigned to the DNS field which pointed to another subdomain.

```
DNS Name {REDACTED}.support.futurevera.thm
```

- Then... another rabbit hole. If you connect to `https`, which I did.. there's nothing useful

- However, if you connect to `http`, you get the following message

```
We canâ€™t connect to the server at flag{REDACTED}.s3-website-us-west-3.amazonaws.com.
```
